      <p>Greetings, I’m Igor.</p>
      <p class="text-sm-left">
        Since september 2018, I have been working as a junior software developer
        at Zagreb Data d.o.o. in Zagreb, Croatia. The junior developer position involves working on
        parts of an enterprise web solution which serves as an extension and enhancement of a legacy desktop software.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm-left">
        The project I have spent most of my time at this position is a document management application,
        which is a module of the main solution.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm-left">
        Before starting my developer career, I have worked
        as a junior consultant and customer support for the same company.
        The position included consulting with clients and solving e-mail and phone requests,
        as well as assisting in the implementation of the legacy solution. I also had some experience working with MS SQL Server,
        mostly with ad hoc querying, which soon became the favourite part of the job for me.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm-left">
        Following the advice of my current team leader, and my growing interest for working with SQL,
        I started to learn programming. The first language I tried was VB.NET, but I soon switched to C#,
        and have been loving it since.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm-left">
        At my current position, I work with .NET Core, mostly MVC,
        but I also have some experience with Web API. The position includes working on all of the layers
        of the application, from the database to the UI, as well as communicating with users on a daily basis,
        either consulting them or receiving input.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm-left">
        Creating software became my passion, and I’m hungry for knowledge and challenges.
        I love writing code and reading about code.
        One of the best feelings is realizing that you have understood something, that seemed so abstract just a few months ago.
