      <p>Greetings, I’m Igor.</p>

      >I am a software developer currently working for a small AI oriented startup in Zagreb, Croatia.</p>
      <p class="text-sm-left">
        Before starting my developer career, I have briefly worked in audit and corporate finance, as well
        as a software consultant and customer support.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm-left">
        At my current position, I work with .NET Core, mostly with Web API. The position includes working on all of the layers
        of the application, from the database to the UI. I use C# on the back end and Javascript on the front end.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm-left">
        Creating software became my passion, and I’m hungry for knowledge and challenges.
        I love writing code and reading about code.
        One of the best feelings is realizing that you have understood something, that seemed so abstract just a few months ago.
      </p>
